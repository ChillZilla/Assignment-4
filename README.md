Word Ladder project

AA44462 and EAM3422


This project is to detect a word ladder between two words. 

We made the following assumptions: 

1) There are no perfect inputs (i.e. we can recieve anything as an input) and we must act accordingly

2) We will be receiving inputs from a direct call to our computeLadder function

3) The dictionary is passed in as a file and parsed into an ArrayList by our driver

4) The dictionary is passed in sorted, and is about 6000 words
